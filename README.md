# Python: From Fundamentals to Mastery

This repository documents my structured progression through Python concepts and projects, taking a zero-to-hero approach over 16 weeks. It serves as a central hub to track milestones, manage curriculum planning, and ensure consistent skill development through practical application.

## 🧠 Methodology

* **AI-Assisted Workflow:** This is an AI-first learning initiative. I leverage **Gemini** as a technical co-pilot to accelerate curriculum planning, audit code quality for PEP-8 compliance, and assist with complex debugging.
* **Instructional Documentation:** I adopt the **"Feynman Technique"** for documentation. Notes and code comments are written in an instructional style, designed to explain the topic clearly as if being presented to a complete beginner.
* **References:** While I utilize a broad range of data sources (official docs, Books, StackOverflow, blogs, etc.), specific references are cited only when a source was critical to a unique implementation or logic.

## 🗺️ Agile Roadmap

This curriculum is structured into four **Epics** (Phases), each containing four **Sprints** (Weeks).

### 🚩 Epic 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Establish a robust understanding of Python syntax, memory management, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
**Definition of Done:** Able to build complex CLI (Command Line Interface) tools without relying on tutorials.

| Sprint | Focus Area | Deliverable (Project) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Syntax & Logic | 🎮 **Number Guessing Game** (Logic & Control Flow) | 🔲 |

### 🚩 Epic 3: Web & Automation (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal:** Break out of the local environment to interact with the web, APIs, and backend servers.
**Definition of Done:** Able to scrape data, consume APIs, and deploy a basic web application.

| Sprint | Focus Area | Deliverable (Project) | Status |
