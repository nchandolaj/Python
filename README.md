# Python: From Fundamentals to Mastery

This repository documents my structured progression through Python concepts and projects. It serves as a central hub to track milestones, manage curriculum planning, and ensure consistent skill development.

## Methodology

* **AI-Assisted Workflow:** This is an AI-first learning initiative. I leverage **Gemini** as a technical co-pilot to accelerate curriculum planning, audit code quality, and assist with debugging.
* **Instructional Documentation:** I adopt the "Feynman Technique" for documentation. Notes and code comments are written in an instructional style, designed to explain the topic clearly as if being presented in an online course.
* **References:** I will call out references sparingly because I will be using a range of data sorces for my learning and it will be very hard to mention all of them.
